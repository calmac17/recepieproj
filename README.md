# recepieproj
First Odin Project
This will be my first project. Designing a website using all the aspects of HTML I have learnt so far.

Committing changes using Git

Creating a boilerplate

Lists

Absolute and relative links

Before starting I fell confident in all aspects of HTML. My main areas of weakness I feel are in using Git, but I reckon that will come with experience of actually using Git. 

Post project comments:
This project went better than expected, able to carry out all aspects of HTML mostly from memory, used the command line for creating and navigating directories and no issues using Git.

To work on: need to investigate hwo to use Git within VScode as currently only able to use the CL to commit changes. Also need to commit changes more regularly.
