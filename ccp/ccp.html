    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large chicken breasts</li>
        
        <li>340g fusilli pasta</li>
        <li>1 large brown onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>100g chorizo, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>¼ tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
        <li>¼ tsp sweet smoked paprika </li>
        <li>600g tinned chopped tomatoes </li>
        <li>splash white wine (optional)</li> 
        <li> 2 tbsp double cream</li>
        <li> 250g mozzarella</li>
        <li> sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and add the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium–low and gently poach the chicken for 10–15 minutes, or until just cooked through. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool.</li>

        <li>Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil once more and add the pasta. Cook for just 10 minutes, or until the shapes are just softened but still have a lot of bite. Drain thoroughly.</li>
            
        <li> Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Add the onion and chorizo to a large casserole set over a medium–high heat and fry for 7–8 minutes, or until the onion has softened. Add the garlic, followed by the chilli flakes and paprika. Cook until the garlic is aromatic.</li>
            
        <li> Add the tomatoes, washing out the residual tomato juices from each tin with the wine (or water if not using wine). Stir the tomatoes into the sauce and leave to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cream. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            
        <li> Chop the chicken breasts into bite-sized chunks and stir into the sauce along with the pasta. Tear the mozzarella and scatter over the top of the pasta. Finish with more black pepper and bake in the oven for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil about halfway through, once the cheese is brown and bubbling.</li>
