    <p>Preparation time: less than 30 mins. Cooking time: 10 to 30 mins. Serves: 6 to 8.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>500g/1lb 2oz haggis</li>
        <li>1.5kg floury potatoes, peeled and cut into even chunks</li>
        <li>100ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>200ml oz cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1kg swede, peeled and cut into even chunks</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>For the whisky cream sauce</li>
        <li>4 tbsp cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>120ml oz Scotch whisky</li>
        <li>200ml oz beef stock</li>
        <li>200ml double cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the haggis according to the packet instructions.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile make the tatties. Cook the potatoes in a saucepan of salted boiling water for about 12 to 15 minutes until the chunks are soft and tender. Drain in a colander and allow to cool for 5 minutes to get a little fluffy on the outside. Mash the potatoes using a ricer. Heat the milk and cream in a saucepan until just simmering, then add to the mash with the butter. Season and mix until you have a smooth, creamy mash.</li>
        
        <li> To make the neeps, cook the swede in a saucepan of salted boiling water for about 12 to 15 minutes until the chunks are soft and tender. Drain in a colander. Add the butter and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        
        <li>  To make the sauce, toast the pepper in a dry frying pan and set aside. Melt the butter and oil in the pan and add the shallots. Fry until fragrant and soft, but not browned. Pour in the whisky, turn up the heat and simmer for a second. Add the beef stock, then the cream. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for around 10 minutes or until reduced by about half. Stir in the cracked pepper.</li>
        
        <li>  Serve the haggis, neeps and tatties with the whisky sauce on the side.</li>
