        <li>1 brown onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>300g leftover roasted chicken, shredded into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To serve</h4>
    <ul><li> 2 corn on the cobs</li>
        <li>100ml soured cream</li>
        <li>½ lime, zest only</li>
        <li>4 large tortilla wraps</li>
        <li>100g cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into quarters</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the spice mix, combine all of the spices and the crushed bay leaf in a bowl, season with pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>For the guacamole, place the avocado flesh in a bowl along with the lime juice. Add the coriander, chilli and a pinch of salt. Roughly mash together using a fork until combined.
        <li>For the fajitas, heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the onion and pepper and fry for around 6 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently until softened. Add the garlic, fry for a further minute and then add in the spice mix. Stir for 2 minutes until the spices are aromatic. Add the chicken to the pan. Season with salt and pepper and add extra crushed dried chilies, if desired. Add a splash of water to the pan and cook over a medium heat for 4–5 minutes, stirring, until piping hot. Check seasoning and adjust as desired.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and cook the corn on the cobs for 4 to 6 minutes until tender. Remove from the pan, drain and, once cool enough to handle, carefully cut each in half to make 4 small cobs. Mix the soured cream with the lime zest in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>To serve, heat the tortillas in the microwave (according to packet instructions) or in a hot dry frying pan. Serve the chicken mixture in the wraps with the guacamole, soured cream and grated cheese. Serve the corn on the cobs and lime wedges alongside.</li>
    </ol>
